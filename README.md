## "Revenue Analysis of Megaline's Prepaid Plans: Visualizations and Hypothesis Testing"

As an analyst for Megaline, your task is to analyze customer behavior to determine which of the two prepaid plans, Surf or Ultimate, generates more revenue. Using data from 500 customers, you'll assess their usage patterns—calls, texts, and data—in 2018. The project includes creating visualizations and conducting hypothesis testing to compare the profitability of each plan and make recommendations for service improvements.
